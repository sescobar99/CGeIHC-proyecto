## Project Setup

This project has been developed, built, executed, downloaded, and tested using Visual Studio 2019 (Having "Desktop development with C++" workload installed and active). Hence, to improve compatibility, it is recommended to use the same version.

1. Open Visual Studio. This menu will show up. You should select "Clone a repository" (right column) as shown in the image.<br/>![paso1](imgs/setup/1.png)<br/>
2. Paste the repository URL "https://github.com/sescobar99/CGeIHC-proyecto.git" and click Clone. (The other fields can be left as default)<br/>![paso2](imgs/setup/2.png)<br/>
3. This will download and open the repository locally. It may take some time.<br/>![paso3](imgs/setup/3.png).<br/>
4. Look for the solution explorer tool window, then select and open(double click) the file named "CGeIHC-proyecto.sln". This will load the project.<br/>![paso4](imgs/setup/4.png)<br/>
5. Open the "main.cpp" file (double click it).<br/>![paso5](imgs/setup/5.png)<br/>
6. At the top bar change the  platform to x86.<br/>![paso6](imgs/setup/6.png)<br/>
7. Since the program settings have been preloaded when downloading and importing the project from GitHub, you should be able to run it directly. (Click the green arrow or press "F5").<br/>![paso7](imgs/setup/7.png)<br/>

### Troubleshooting
* The irrKlang library may not load properly at first. In such a case it is possible to fix it by repeating step 6, changing from x86 to x64 and back to x86
