## Brief introduction

The objective of this project was to recreate an amusement/dinosaur park using computer graphics techniques. To do it, we proposed a design with different zones which included dinosaurs and several zones of interest. 
The user is encouraged to explore the virtual scene using the provided map, controls, and list of elements.


## Map

![mapa](../imgs/UserDocs/map.png)

The island is divided into two main zones.

The safari area (green one) has a volcano, the tyrannosaurus, and mosasaurs cages, and a train touring them all.

In the other one, the commercial area (gray one) you can find a restaurant, housing, a hotel, and a gift shop.

Here is an aerial picture of the island

## How to move and explore


You can move forward, backward, and sidewards using "WASD" keys
* W: Forward
* S: Backward
* A: Leftward
* D: Rightward

You can also rotate the camera view using the mouse cursor. If you move it up, the camera will rotate upwards. If you move it down, the camera will rotate downwards, and so on.

**Beware** of the 3dimensional movements. This means that depending on where the camera is pointing using WASD keys will move you on a different axis

"P" key will toggle the background music **[PENDING]**
