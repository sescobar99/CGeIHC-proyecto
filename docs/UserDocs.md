## Brief introduction

The objective of this project was to recreate an amusement/dinosaur park using computer graphics techniques. To do it, we proposed a design with different zones which included dinosaurs and several zones of interest. 
The user is encouraged to explore the virtual scene using the provided map, controls, and list of elements.


## Map

The island is divided into two main zones.

The safari area (green one) has a volcano, the tyrannosaurus, and mosasaurs cages, and a train touring them all.

In the other one, the commercial area (gray one) you can find a restaurant, housing, a hotel, and a gift shop.

Here is an aerial picture of the island
